# Mandatory exercise 2

I am going to solve this exercise using Elixir and its tools provided to host TCP servers and clients. 

TODO:

- [ ] Add more logging to server module
- [ ] General code clean up:
  - [ ] Make sure that all commitment business goes through the `Commitment` module
  - [ ] Organize Client code in separate functions for cleaner code
  - [ ] Organize Server code in separate functions for cleaner code (?)
- [ ] Capture logs for the written report
- [ ] Write the report
